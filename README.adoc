== Documentation Toolchain

The documentation is generated with https://antora.org/[Antora] toolchain.

=== Running Antora

You can either https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/[install Antora locally], 
or use the docker image:

The docker image is preferred way - it's super simple, just run:

----
podman run -v $PWD:$PWD:Z -w $PWD  --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml
----

Or locally

----
podman run -v $PWD:$PWD:Z -w $PWD  --rm -t antora/antora local-antora-playbook.yml
----

=== UI

You don't have build UI by default. Only reason to build UI is if you have to modify it.

The code for UI is located here:

----
git clone https://github.com/tackler-ng/antora-ui-tackler
----

==== UI Bundle

If you don't have `node` environment installed, easiest way 
to generate UI is build it in side container:
 
----
podman run --publish 127.0.0.1:5252:5252 -v $PWD:$PWD:Z -w $PWD  --rm -it node:22-alpine ash
----

Then inside the container:

----
npm install
npx gulp preview
npx gulp bundle
----
